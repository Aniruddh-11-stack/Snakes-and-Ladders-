## Synopsis of the code

This code implements a solution to a board game similar to Snakes and Ladders. The game is played on a board with 100 vertices. Players move a token from vertex to vertex based on the roll of a die (which is not simulated in this code).

The code defines an adjacency list to represent the connections between vertices. Each vertex can move to 6 other vertices in a single turn. Additionally, the code allows for the introduction of "ladders" and "snakes" which act as shortcuts on the board.

Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

*  **`replaceEdgeFor6PreceedingVertices`:** This function replaces the outgoing edges for the 6 vertices preceding a given vertex (`startVertex`) with a new edge (`newEdge`). This function is used to implement ladders, where climbing a ladder takes the player to a higher vertex.
*  **`breadthFirstSearch`:** This function performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal on the adjacency list starting from vertex 1. It keeps track of the level (number of moves) required to reach each vertex and the parent vertex in the shortest path.
*  **`printPathFromSourceToDestination`:** This function recursively prints the shortest path from vertex 1 (source) to a destination vertex (in this case, vertex 100) based on the parent information collected during BFS.

The code finally outputs:

* The minimum number of moves required to reach vertex 100 (the destination) from vertex 1 (the source).
* The shortest path (sequence of vertices) to reach vertex 100.

Overall, this code simulates a game similar to Snakes and Ladders and finds the optimal strategy (shortest path) to win the game.
